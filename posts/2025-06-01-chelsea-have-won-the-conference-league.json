  "content": "<h1>Chelsea Make History with Conference League Victory</h1>\n<p>Chelsea have beaten Real Betis 4-1 in the UEFA Conference League final to complete their set of European silverware, becoming the first club in history to win all five of UEFA's men's club competitions.</p>\n<h2>A Tale of Two Halves</h2>\n<p>The final in Wrocław, Poland, was a show of contrasts. Real Betis came out firing in the first half, taking the lead through Ezzalzouli's ninth-minute strike after Isco's clever cross found the Moroccan winger, who composed himself before firing into the bottom corner. This counter-attack came from an error from Gusto, who was a surprise start after captain Reece James's incredible form as of late.</p>\n<p>The Spanish side's high-energy pressing game disrupted Chelsea's rhythm, with Betis goalkeeper Adrián making crucial saves and their defense standing firm. Despite Chelsea dominating possession with 65%, they struggled to create clear-cut chances in a frustrating first 45 minutes.</p>\n<h2>The Maresca Masterclass</h2>\n<p>Everything changed at halftime. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca made the crucial decision to bring on captain Reece James, a substitution that transformed the game's dynamic. The tactical adjustment proved to be the difference, as Maresca later explained: \"We adjusted something tactical at half-time and the second half we were much better.\"</p>\n<p>The turning point came when Betis were forced to withdraw the influential Ezzalzouli due to injury after 53 minutes. With their key attacking threat gone, the Spanish side's defensive structure began to crumble. Chelsea's bolstered right flank, along with Betis's weakened, the attack began to flow with Cole Palmer overloading the wing.</p>\n<h2>Palmer's Masterpiece</h2>\n<p>Cole Palmer, named Player of the Match, orchestrated Chelsea's remarkable comeback with two sublime assists. On 65 minutes, his perfectly weighted lofted pass found Enzo Fernández, who headed home the equalizer past the exposed Adrián.</p>\n<p>Just five minutes later, Palmer struck again, turning his marker with ease before delivering another exquisite cross for Nicolas Jackson to easily put in (with his chest? shoulder? who knows...). Palmer's frustration with Chelsea's first-half performance was evident in his post-match comments: \"I was sick of getting the ball and just going backwards and sideways.\"</p>\n<h2>Closing the Show</h2>\n<p>Substitute Jadon Sancho added gloss to the scoreline in the 83rd minute with a composed curled finish from an angle. Moises Caicedo completed the rout in stoppage time, firing home from the edge of the box to make it 4-1.</p>\n<h2>Historic Achievement</h2>\n<p>This victory represents more than just another trophy for Chelsea. They have now become the first club to win all five of UEFA's men's club competitions, adding the Conference League to their collection that includes two Champions League titles, two Europa League victories, two UEFA Super Cup wins, and two Cup Winners' Cup triumphs.</p>\n<p>The success also ends a remarkable streak, breaking Spanish clubs' run of nine consecutive victories over English opposition in UEFA finals since 2001/02. For Real Betis, playing in their first major UEFA final, it was a heartbreaking end to what had been an excellent European campaign.</p>\n<h2>Building for the Future</h2>\n<p>For Maresca and Chelsea, this triumph serves as validation of his tactical approach and a foundation for future success. \"To build a winning mentality you need to win games, to win competitions,\" he said. \"The trophy we have won tonight is going to make us better.\"</p>\n<p>After four years without silverware, Chelsea have ended their drought in style, setting a record for the most goals scored in a Conference League season (42) and winning 11 of their 12 matches in the competition proper.</p>\n<p>This victory marks not just the completion of Chelsea's European collection, but potentially the beginning of a new era of success under Maresca's guidance.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fadf7c37c23c05f09adb23d495fe162b08ce60e/130_0_4975_3981/master/4975.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\"></p>"
